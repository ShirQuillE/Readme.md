##Plan for Office 365 Groups governance

Office 365 Groups has  a rich set of tools to implement any governance capabilities your organization might provides require. This article guides IT pros to ask the right questions to determine their requirements for governance and how to meet them based on their organizational profile.

###Why Office 365 Groups?

![Pic1](C:\Users\sdbuser\Desktop\Pic1.PNG)





We know that organizations today are using a diverse toolset. whether approved or shadow IT. When we peel back the covers and look at how companies are working today, we see a myriad of tools in use. There’s the team of developers who is using team chat, the executives who use sending email, and the HR team that helps the entire organization connect connecting over enterprise social. The reason multiple collaboration tools are in use is because every group is unique and has their own functional needs and workstyle. Some will use only email while others will live primarily in chat. And If end users find feel the IT approved provided tools do not fit their needs, option for works as their preferred tool, they will likely ’ll simply download the their favorite consumer grade version app which supports their scenarios. Although this process allows end users to get started quickly, it which  and that leads to a terrible frustrating user experience across the organization with with multiple logins, difficulty sharing, and no single view of content place to view content.
This concept is referred to as “Shadow IT” and poses a significant risk for to organizations .as shadow IT develops, It reduces the ability to and there’s no way without a way to uniformly manage a user’s access, ensure security, and service compliance needs. 
Office 365 Groups empowers users by simplifying the process and simplifies the process reduces the risk of shadow IT by providing many of the tools needed to collaborate in a single creation step.
Groups in Office 365 Groups let you choose a set of people with which you wish to collaborate that you wish to collaborate with and easily sets up a collection of resources for those people to share. provides Manually assigning permissions to resources is a thing of the past as adding members to the Office 365 Group automatically grants the needed permissions to all assets provided by the group.

##Technical Architecture 
There are three main types communication modalities supported by of Office 365 Groups. Groups can be created within these experiences and used across the Office 365 suite:

- [Outlook](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/learn-about-office-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US "Outlook") : shared inbox mode of collaboration through email with a shared group inbox and calendar(DL++)

- [Microsoft Teams](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/learn-about-office-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US "Microsoft Teams" ) : a persistent chat-based workspace where you can have informal, real-time, conversations around a variety of topics, organized by very focused topics or specific sub-groups within the group which adds persistent chat capability 
- [Yammer](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/learn-about-office-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US): enterprise social experience for collaboration

Note: When a creating a new group via other teamwork applications such as SharePoint, Planner or Stream will create an Office 365 Group with an Outlook communication modality with the ability to connect to Microsoft Teams.  

Depending on the type of where an Office 365 Group is created, certain resources are provisioned automatically, such as:

- Shared Inbox – For email conversations between your members. This inbox has an email address and can be set to accept messages from people outside the group and even outside your organization, much like a traditional distribution list.
  Shared Calendar – For scheduling events related to the group
- SharePoint Team Site – A central repository for information, links and content relating to your group
- SharePoint Document Library – A central place for the group to store and share files
- Shared OneNote Notebook – For gathering ideas, research, and information
- SharePoint Team Site – A central repository for information, links and content relating to your group
- Planner – For assigning and managing project tasks among your group members
- Yammer Group – A common place to have conversations and share information
- Microsoft Teams –  chat-based workspace in Office 365 

To understand learn more about which resources are created for each type of group, visit [Learn about Office 365 Groups.](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/learn-about-office-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2)

Note: When a new Office 365 Group is created via Yammer or Teams, they are not visible in Outlook or the address book because the primary communication between those users happens in their respective clients. 

Note: When a new Microsoft team is created, the Office 365 group object has the Hidden From Exchange Clients Enabled property set to True,  which  will set the group to  not be visible in the Outlook left hand navigation and will not be visible in the address book. Additionally, the group name will not resolve when attempting to resolve the address while authoring a new mail message in Outlook. See Hidden From Exchange Clients Enabled Hide From Exchange Clients for more details.

Note: When a new Yammer group is created, the Office 365 group does not create a group mailbox or calendar resource. Therefore, a Yammer group cannot be connected to Microsoft Teams. See [Yammer and Groups](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0gDKMO8-WD5mlZo7SCEFjGbg8loKf1aCZC3PPNmplw/edit#bookmark=id.30j0zll) 

##Where to start a conversation

There are multiple places to have a conversation within Office 365 and understanding where to start a conversation can help organizations define a strategy for communication.

![Pic2](C:\Users\sdbuser\Desktop\Pic2.PNG)

##Managing and governing Office 365 at scale

There exist a rich set of tools to implement any governance capabilities your organization might require. The following describes the capabilities, best practice and guidance to ask the right questions to determine the requirements for governance, and how to meet them

###Control who can create Office 365 Groups

Groups can be created by end-users from multiple end-points including Outlook, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, and other environments. 

![Pic4](C:\Users\sdbuser\Desktop\Pic4.PNG)



Guidance​

- Strongly consider self-service to empower group owners!​
- Use dynamic membership to configure Security group’s members​
- Document and communicate how to request a group​
- Revisit who can create groups during your cloud journey​
- Consider using dynamic membership to configure Security group’s members​ to control group creation.
- Assess which groups scenarios can managed via a dynamic membership and allow self-service for the rest

There are three primary models of provisioning in Office 365 Groups: Open, IT-led or Controlled. Each has its own advantages.

| Model          | Advantages                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Open (default) | Users can create their own groups as needed without needing to wait for, or bother IT |
| IT-led         | Users request a group from IT. IT can guide them in selecting the best collaboration tools for their needs |
| Controlled     | Group creation restricted to specific people, teams or services (See: [Control who can create ](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-who-can-create-office-365-groups-4c46c8cb-17d0-44b5-9776-005fced8e618) |



７ Note Limiting group and team creation can slow your users’ productivity because many Office 365 services require that groups be created for the service to function. For additional information, navigate to and expand [Why control who creates Office 365 Groups?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/create-groups/manage-creation-of-groups?view=o365-worldwide#why-control-who-creates-office-365-groups)

###Group soft delete and restore​
####Guidance​

- Communicate the restore process to your users​
- Train your helpdesk team​
- Track upcoming groups that will be deleted using PowerShell script​

|                 |                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Decision points | Do you require that certain assets to be archived for long term storage? Do you have certain retention requirements for your organization? |
| Next Steps      | Communicate and publish the delete and restore policies to inform users of the behavior they can expect  Document your organizations requirements for monitoring deleted groups. Plan to implement these requirements as part of your groups rollout. |

Group naming policy​

_Guidance​_

- Use short strings as suffix​

- Use attributes with values​

- Don’t be too creative, total name length has a maximum of 264 characters​

- Upload your organization specific blocked words to restrict usage



  |                 |                                                              |
  | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Decision points | Which provisioning  model fits your organization requirements? Does your organization require limiting group creation to administrators? Does your organization require limiting group creation to security group members?Does your organization require some groups to be created dynamically based on user attributes e.g. department? |
  | Next Steps      | Document your organization’s requirements for naming Office 365 groups. Plan to implement these requirements as part of your groups rollout. Communicate and publish the naming policies and standards to inform end users. |

Group expiration policy​ 

_Guidance​_

- Pilot with specific groups initially​

- Choose inactive groups based on the activity report in Office Admin center​

- Communicate renewal process to group owners​

- Onboard your helpdesk team​

- Ensure groups have multiple owners & configure email for orphan groups
  ​

  |                 |                                                              |
  | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Decision points | Does your organization require specifying an expiration date for teams? Determine the strategy for dealing with orphan groups? |
  | Next Steps      | Document your organization’s requirements for group expiration, data retention, and archiving. Plan to implement these requirements as part of your groups rollout. Plan to implement a custom job to report on groups that have single owners or are ownerless |

####Group guest access​

#####Guidance

- Enable guest access! Block for specific groups if required.
- Govern using allow/block guest domains, guest inviter role, access reviews, terms of use​
- Track guest user activity via audit logs​

|                 |                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Decision points | Do you have specific domains you wish to block or allow guest users from? Do you need to restrict the ability to add guests to teams on a per-group basis? Does your organization require to present relevant disclaimers for legal or compliance requirements? Does your organization have the need to reduce administrative overhead of adding and removing users? Does your organization expect audit controls for guest/external access? |
| Next Steps      | Document requirements for guest/external access for certain classified groups including the retention period and occurrence. Document organization’s requirements for which groups will require terms of use and access review.  Perform reviews to efficiently manage group memberships for both internal and guest users |

Group policies & information protection​

####Guidance​ 

- Configure classification, usage guidelines, labels aligned with your org needs​
- Retention policies can be defined independently of labels​
- Audit groups activities: creation, deletion, etc.​
- Control group privacy and guest access based on classification

|                 |                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Decision points | Does your organization require the classifications of all content? Does your organization require content to be retained for a specific period of time?  Does your organization require specific data retention policies be applied to groups? Does your organization expect to require the ability to archive inactive groups to preserve the content? Do group creators need the ability to assign organization-specific classifications to teams? |
| Next Steps      | Document your organization’s requirements for classification.  Determine the policies to be enforced based on the classificaiton e.g. sensitivity, retention, guest access Define the sensitivity labels for your organization and what protection settings you want associated.  Define a label policy to control which users and groups see those labels Plan to implement these requirements as a part of your groups rollout |

Upgrade traditional collaboration tools 

####Guidance​

- Easily upgrade all your eligible DL in seconds via the Exchange Admin center or using PowerShell cmdlets.
- Connect existing SharePoint team sites to new Office 365 Groups



|                 |                                                              |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Decision points | Does your organization have distribution lists that are [not eligible](about:blank) for upgrade? Determine which type of group is the distribution list best migrated to? |
| Next Steps      | Identify which distribution lists would be candidates for upgrading to Office 365 Groups  Analyze your existing SharePoint team sites to see which sites are ready to be group-connected Let other teams in your company know that you upgraded your distribution group and what steps you took to make it successful! |

Groups reporting

The Office 365 Admin center has a reporting tool that provides information on:

- Track total groups and inactive/active groups​
- Track both Exchange and SharePoint storage used​
- View group activity across group mailbox conversations, group site/files activity, etc.
- Details around group member and external member counts

#####Guidance​

- You can use the Groups activity reports to gain insights into the activity of Office 365 Groups in your organization and see how many Office 365 Groups are being created and used
- Monitor group activity across group mailbox conversations, group site/files activity, details around group membership including external member counts.
- Monitor regularly to reach out to group owners of active groups to learn uses cases and amplify them internally​
- Leverage Power BI content packs for additional insights

####Getting started based on your cloud adoption journey 

Office 365 Groups provides a rich set of governance capabilities your organization might require. Consider the following organization profiles as guidance to understand best practices, ask the right questions to determine the requirements for governance, and how to meet them.

*Consider the following organization profiles*

#####Small business
​	
Consider an organization that has deployed Office 365 with at least Exchange Online and SharePoint Online licenses that includes the Business Essentials and Business Premium plans, and the Enterprise E1, E3 and E5 plans with no Azure Active Director Premium licensing

|            |                                                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Guidance   | Consider a self-service provisioning model  Groups in Outlook & SharePoint sites are [private by default](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Groups/Groups-in-Outlook-and-Group-connected-team-sites-are-now-private/m-p/186395) Groups can be created by upgrading existing distribution lists (DLs) either one-by-one or in bulk via PowerShell. See [Upgrade distribution lists to Office 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Upgrade-distribution-lists-to-Office-365-Groups-in-Outlook-787D7A75-E201-46F3-A242-F698162FF09F) Enable guest access but govern using allow/block guest domains. Use group reporting to gain insights on how users are using groups. |
| Next Steps | Consider using [site designs and site scripts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0gDKMO8-WD5mlZo7SCEFjGbg8loKf1aCZC3PPNmplw/edit#bookmark=id.1fob9te) to define the default design tothe controls using the actions defined within the [JSON schema reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0gDKMO8-WD5mlZo7SCEFjGbg8loKf1aCZC3PPNmplw/edit#bookmark=id.1fob9te) Review [groups reporting](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-Reports-in-the-admin-center-Office-365-groups-a27f1a99-3557-4f85-9560-a28e3d822a40)  Track total groups and inactive/active groups Track both Exchange and SharePoint storage used View group activity across group mailbox conversations, group site/files activity, etc. |



####Medium-sized business 	

In addition to the above recommendations consider the following for medium-sized business who has deployed Office 365 with at least an Enterprise E3/E5 with Azure Active Directory Premium P1 licenses

_Guidance_

- Decide on an Open or IT-led provisioning model. 
  Consider creating certain groups tied to [dynamic memberships rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/groups-dynamic-membership) based on Azure AD attributes like Department
- Define classifications within your organization e.g. Highly Confidential, Confidential (default), General​
- Define the policies based on classification such as retention and sensitivity
- SharePoint is the content service for every Office 365 Group. Consider designing and [Deploying SharePoint Online sites for three tiers of protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/deploy-sharepoint-online-sites-for-three-tiers-of-protection) (baseline, sensitive, and highly confidential). For more information about these three tiers of protection, [see Secure SharePoint Online sites and files.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/enterprise/secure-sharepoint-online-sites-and-files)
- Both public and private groups are listed in the GAL by default. Determine which groups you want to appear in the GAL specifically groups created outside of Microsoft Teams.  Use the [Set-Unified Group](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt238274(v=exchg.160).aspx) cmdlet's "HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled" or “HidefromExchangeClients” to hide specific groups.

| Guidance   | Consider a self-service provisioning model  Groups in Outlook & SharePoint sites are [private by default](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Office-365-Groups/Groups-in-Outlook-and-Group-connected-team-sites-are-now-private/m-p/186395) Groups can be created by upgrading existing distribution lists (DLs) either one-by-one or in bulk via PowerShell. See [Upgrade distribution lists to Office 365 Groups](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Upgrade-distribution-lists-to-Office-365-Groups-in-Outlook-787D7A75-E201-46F3-A242-F698162FF09F) Enable guest access but govern using allow/block guest domains. Use group reporting to gain insights on how users are using groups. |
| Next Steps | Consider using [site designs and site scripts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0gDKMO8-WD5mlZo7SCEFjGbg8loKf1aCZC3PPNmplw/edit#bookmark=id.1fob9te) to define the default design tothe controls using the actions defined within the [JSON schema reference](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j0gDKMO8-WD5mlZo7SCEFjGbg8loKf1aCZC3PPNmplw/edit#bookmark=id.1fob9te) Review [groups reporting](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-Reports-in-the-admin-center-Office-365-groups-a27f1a99-3557-4f85-9560-a28e3d822a40)  Track total groups and inactive/active groups Track both Exchange and SharePoint storage used View group activity across group mailbox conversations, group site/files activity, etc. |
